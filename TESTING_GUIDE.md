# FPS Starter - Manual Testing Guide

## Updated Features Implementation

This document outlines the implemented features that address the issues mentioned in Issue #2.

### ‚úÖ Fixed Issues

#### 1. **Fixed Jumping Mechanics**
- **Problem**: Space key caused continuous upward movement instead of proper jumping
- **Solution**: 
  - Integrated FPS controller with Avian3D physics system
  - Added ground detection using ray casting
  - Implemented impulse-based jumping that only works when grounded
  - Added proper player physics body with capsule collider

#### 2. **Implemented Weapon System**
- **Features**:
  - Three weapon types: Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun
  - Weapons spawn as pickups in the world
  - Press E to pick up weapons (within 2 units range)
  - Left mouse button to fire equipped weapon
  - Ray-cast based hit detection
  - Different stats per weapon (damage, fire rate, ammo, range)
  - Weapon sway and bobbing effects during movement

#### 3. **Added Interaction System**
- **Features**:
  - E key interaction for items within range
  - Health packs (red cubes) that restore player health
  - Ammo packs (yellow cubes) that refill current weapon
  - Visual interaction prompts appear when near items
  - Player health system with damage/healing mechanics

#### 4. **Enhanced HUD Overlay**
- **New HUD Elements**:
  - Health display (bottom left): Shows current/max health
  - Ammo display (bottom right): Shows current/max ammo for equipped weapon
  - Weapon display (bottom center): Shows name of equipped weapon
  - Existing crosshair (center): Remains functional
  - All elements update in real-time

### üéÆ Controls

| Key/Input | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| WASD | Movement (horizontal) |
| Mouse | Look around |
| Space | Jump (only when grounded, physics-based) |
| E | Interact with items/pickups |
| Left Mouse | Fire equipped weapon |
| Tab | Toggle cursor lock |
| Esc | Exit game |

### üåç World Items

When you start the game, you'll find:

**Weapon Pickups:**
- Pistol (blue) at position (-5, 1, -5)
- Rifle (dark gray) at position (5, 1, -5)  
- Shotgun (brown) at position (0, 1, -8)

**Health Packs (red cubes):**
- +25 HP at position (-3, 0.5, 3)
- +50 HP at position (3, 0.5, 3)

**Ammo Packs (yellow cubes):**
- +30 rounds at position (-3, 0.5, -3)
- +60 rounds at position (3, 0.5, -3)

### üß™ Testing Instructions

1. **Test Movement & Jumping**:
   - Move around with WASD
   - Try jumping with Space - should only work when on ground
   - Verify no continuous flying when holding Space

2. **Test Weapon System**:
   - Walk near a weapon pickup and press E
   - Check HUD shows weapon name and ammo count
   - Fire weapon with left mouse button
   - Verify ammo decreases with each shot

3. **Test Interaction System**:
   - Walk near health/ammo packs
   - Watch for "Press E" interaction prompt
   - Press E to use items
   - Verify health/ammo values update in HUD

4. **Test HUD Elements**:
   - Verify health display shows 100/100 initially
   - Pick up weapon and check ammo display updates
   - Take damage (not implemented yet) or heal to test health display
   - Verify weapon name appears when weapon is equipped

### üéØ Implementation Details

**Physics-Based Movement:**
- Player has dynamic rigid body with capsule collider
- Ground detection via ray casting downward
- Jump impulse applied only when grounded
- Locked rotation to prevent physics tumbling

**Weapon System Architecture:**
- Modular weapon components with stats
- Inventory system tracks held weapons
- Ray-cast hit detection for firing
- Weapon sway based on movement state

**Interaction System Architecture:**
- Range-based interaction detection
- Component-based item types (HealthPack, AmmoPack, WeaponPickup)
- Dynamic UI prompts that show/hide based on proximity
- Clean pickup/consumption mechanics

**HUD System:**
- Real-time queries to player components
- Separate UI components for each display element
- Color-coded information (red=health, yellow=ammo, green=weapon)

### ‚ú® Visual Improvements

- Weapons have realistic colors and sizes as visual pickups
- Health packs glow red with emissive material
- Ammo packs glow yellow with emissive material
- Professional HUD layout with proper positioning
- Clear interaction feedback

All features work together to create a cohesive FPS experience that addresses the original German language requirements for proper movement, weapon handling, item interaction, and HUD overlay.
